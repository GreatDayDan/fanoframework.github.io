<h1 class="major">Creating Hello World web application from scratch</h1>

In this step by step tutorial, we are going to create a simple CGI web application
that display greeting message from scratch.

## Application Functionalities

- Page which display greeting message

## Project directory structure

For this project, we will create following directory structures

```
-hello-world
--bin
---unit
--src
---App
----Hello
-----Controllers
-----Views
---Resources
----Templates
-----Hello
--tools
--public
---css
---js
```

- `bin` directory will store any binary files generated by compiler. Our final executable application binary will be store here.
- `bin/unit` will store any compiled unit binaries generated by compiler.
- `src` directory will store our application source codes.
- `tools` directory will store helper shell scripts.
- `public` directory is our application document root which will contains any public assets accessible from client such CSS and JavaScript files.

## Creating main program

Create new file `hello-world/src/hello.pas` and put following code

```
program hello;

uses

    fano,
    helloapp;

var
    appInstance : IWebApplication;

begin
    appInstance := THelloApp.create();
    appInstance.run();
end.
```

This will be our main application which will be compiled into executable binary.

## Creating hello application unit

Create new file `hello-world/src/helloapp.pas` and put following code

```
unit helloapp;

interface

uses
    fano;

type

    THelloApp = class(TSimpleWebApplication)
    protected
        procedure buildDependencies(const container : IDependencyContainer); override;
        procedure buildRoutes(const container : IDependencyContainer); override;
        function initDispatcher(const container : IDependencyContainer) : IDispatcher; override;
    end;

implementation

uses

    sysutils;

    procedure THelloApp.buildDependencies(const container : IDependencyContainer);
    begin
        //TODO: implement build application dependencies
    end;

    procedure THelloApp.buildRoutes(const container : IDependencyContainer);
    begin
        //TODO: implement build application routes
    end;

    function THelloApp.initDispatcher(const container : IDependencyContainer) : IDispatcher;
    begin
        //TODO: implement build application dispatcher
    end;
end.
```

## Build application dependencies

In order to work, application needs some service to be registered into
dependency container. Add following code in `buildDependencies()` method

```
procedure THelloApp.buildDependencies(const container : IDependencyContainer);
begin
    container.factory('routeMiddlewares', TNullMiddlewareCollectionAwareFactory.create());
end;
```

In code above, we register service name `routeMiddlewares` and its factory class
which responsible to create instance of `IMiddlewareCollectionAware` interface.
We will not use middleware yet, `TNullMiddlewareCollectionAwareFactory` creates null class which implements that interface but actually does nothing.

## Build application routes

A route is basically an association rule between request and code that handles it.
Read [Working with router](/working-with-router) for more information.

Add code to `buildRoutes()` method to register a route.

```
procedure THelloApp.buildRoutes(const container : IDependencyContainer);
var router : IRouter;
begin
    router := container.get('router') as IRouter;
    try
        router.get('/', container.get('helloController') as IRouteHandler);
    finally
        router := nil;
    end;
end;
```

So when user made `GET` request to `http://[our app hostname]/`, controller
registered as `helloController` in dependency container will handles it.
